# JavaScript: Events

This project was created to develop and improve my skills in JavaScript Events.


## :technologist: Technologies and metodologies

In this task, my job was to create event:
- showing current photo;
- showing random photos as a bottom slider;
- choosing next or previous photo;
- closing preview if user clicks outside the image field (using propagation).
